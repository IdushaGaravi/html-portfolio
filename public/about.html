<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science and Engineering undergrad at the University of Moratuwa, 
  currently in my second year of diving deep into the digital world.
</p>

<p>
  I love turning ideas into interactive web experiences-whether it's a sleek portfolio, 
  a dynamic app, or a backend system that just works. My interests lie at the intersection of 
  creative design and efficient code. I enjoy experimenting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
  frameworks like React, while also sharpening my skills in algorithms, databases, and problem solving.

  This site is a small window into the projects I've built so far. Each one has taught me something new, 
  and there's plenty more to come!
